Package: forceR
Title: Force Measurement Analyses
Description: An R package for animal closing force measurement cleaning and analysis. forceR was initially written and optimized to deal with insect bite force measurements, but can be used for any time series measurements. forceR includes a full workflow to load, plot and crop data, correct amplifier and baseline drifts, identify individual peak shapes (bites), rescale (normalize) peak curves, and find best polynomial fits to describe and analyze force curve shapes.
